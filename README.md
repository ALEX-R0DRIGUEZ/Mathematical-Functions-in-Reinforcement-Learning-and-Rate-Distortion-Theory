# Mathematical Functions in Reinforcement Learning and Rate Distortion Theory

Various mathematical functions/methods in Reinforcement Learning and Rate Distortion Theory implemented in MATLAB. Includes Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Convex Analytic Method, Kalman Filter, Q-Learning, and Rate Distortion.

## Reinforcement Learning - Stochastic Control problem set

The following functions use parameters and initial conditions from a problem set from my 4th year Stochastic Control course:
- ValueIteration.m
- PolicyIteration.m
- ConvexAnalytic.m
- KalmanFilter.m
- QLearning.m

Transition probablities, parameters, and cost functions are defined in the code.

## Rate Distortion - Data Compression & Source Coding problem set

The following function solves for rate distortion using the Lloyd Quantizer algorithm: 
- RateDistortion.m
